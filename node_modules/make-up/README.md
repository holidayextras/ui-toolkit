## About

All of the configs for all of the linters and some third party tools.

## Usage

### Install

    npm install make-up --save-dev

Any existing eslint ruleset will be removed from the current directory upon installation.

### Consume

This library's functions can be run programmatically:

```javascript
var makeup = require('make-up');
var options = {
  dirs: []
};
makeup.check(options, function(error, results) {
  ...
});
```

* [scss-lint](https://github.com/ahmednuaman/grunt-scss-lint) - `config: makeup.path( 'scss-lint.yml' )`

### Linting

To lint all the files in specific directories run the following:

    node_modules/.bin/make-up directory1 directory2

The current directory is always automatically included.

This will automatically download the lint [ruleset](https://github.com/holidayextras/culture/blob/linting/.eslintrc) from Holiday Extras [culture repo](https://github.com/holidayextras/culture)
and check any JS or JSX files found.

If any errors are found a non zero exit status will be returned equal to the number of errors.

#### Limiting by date

To only check files newer than a specific date, use the following option:

    node_modules/.bin/make-up -s 'Sun, 09 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT' directory1 directory2
    node_modules/.bin/make-up -s 'Tue Jun 09 2015 14:49:57 GMT+0100 (BST)' directory1 directory2

Alternatively, to only check files newer than a specific git history date, use the following option:

    node_modules/.bin/make-up -g 'Sun, 09 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT' directory1 directory2
    node_modules/.bin/make-up -g 'Tue Jun 09 2015 14:49:57 GMT+0100 (BST)' directory1 directory2

The `-s` (since) and `-g` (gitSince) arguments can be in any format that the [JS Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) constructor supports.

## Extending

To add a new integration to this project follow the steps below:

1. Create a new js module in the `lib/integrations` directory.
1. Make sure this module exports an object.
1. Create a function named `run` on the new integration object, this will take three arguments; an `options` object, a writable `stream` and `callback` function.
1. The `run` function will output any detail to the user using the provided stream.
1. The `run` function will run the given callback in the usual node manner with the first argument being set as an error object and the second being the given writeable stream.
1. Add the new integration to the `checkIntegrations` object in the `index.js` file.

### Testing eslint configs

The script `script/calculate_eslint_config.js` can be used to show what exact config is used by eslint, this will include any autogenerated rules. This
script expects one argument, which is a eslint config file.
